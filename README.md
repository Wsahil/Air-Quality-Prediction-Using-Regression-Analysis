# Air-Quality-Prediction-Using-Regression-Analysis
This project aimed to develop predictive models for air quality index (AQI) prediction using regression analysis techniques. By leveraging machine learning algorithms and time series forecasting methods, the project sought to provide insights into air pollution patterns and support informed decision-making for air quality management.
